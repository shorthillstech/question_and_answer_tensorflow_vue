## What is this for?
This is a Machine learning Repository which predicts the answer questions based on the content of a given passage. using npm package ```@tensflow/qna```. 

## Models and technologies used.

The model can be used to build a system that can answer usersâ€™ questions in natural language. It was created using a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on SQuAD 1.1 dataset.

(BERT)[https://github.com/google-research/bert], or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a method of pre-training language representations which obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of Natural Language Processing tasks.

The model takes a passage and a question as input, then returns a segment of the passage that most likely answers the question.
